# serialdevices README

This is useful for microcontroller development. It lists the Serial Device and allows for giving them a name. So instead of seeing COM3, you can rename it to ESP32_SENSOR. Since Com port numbers change, it uses the DeviceID/pnpid to be more accurate for the search.

## Features

Pressing the scan button starts a serial device scan. It will continue to run for about 15 seconds or until a device has been pluggedin or removed.  
You can click on a Device and give it a new name.
The REd X to the right of a port removes the new name but doesn't delete the port.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements
